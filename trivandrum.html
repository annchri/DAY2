                            <p>The Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of the state of Kerala, India. The name of the city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam and Tamil translates to "The City of Lord Ananta" (The City Of Lord Vishnu).[1] The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura.[2][3] While as per some traditions the Ananthapura temple in Kumbla in Kasaragod district in Kerala is considered as the original spiritual seat of the deity ("Moolasthanam"), architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu.[4]

                                The principal deity is Padmanabhaswamy (Vishnu), who is enshrined in the "Anantha Shayana" posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the infinite serpent Adi Shesha.[5] Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the Travancore royal family. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the current trustee of the temple. </p>

                            <p> Shankumugham Beach is a beach in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, south India. The beach is on the western side of Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) and is very close to Trivandrum International Airport.

                                The vast stretch of white sand and the serene atmosphere, away from the crowd in the city, provide all the ingredients for relaxation and for spending an ideal evening. - The city of the Holy Anantha | India|url=https://trivandrum.nic.in/tourist-place/sankhumugham-beach/%7Caccess-date=2020-09-07%7Clanguage=en-US}}</ref> with eating kiosks and open-air theatre with car parking facilities. Good food can be enjoyed at the Old Coffee House, just across the beach, which is also a vantage point for enjoying the sunset. The beach is not well maintained, with garbage littering the entire area.
                                
                                Shanghumugham beach is considered as the ‘Arattukadavu’ of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan[1] - The presiding deity of the city. Thousands of Hindus perform ‘Bali Tharpanam’ during special occasions.[2] Shankhumugham is the prime location for Ganesh Nimarjan at the time of Vinayaka Chathurthi.[3]</p>
