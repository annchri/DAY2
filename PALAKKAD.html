                                    <p class="mb-5">Palakkad (Malayalam: [pɐːlɐkːɐːɖɨ̆] (listen)), formerly known as Palghat, historically known as Palakkattussery is a city and municipality in the Indian state of Kerala. It is the administrative headquarters of the Palakkad District. Palakkad is most densely populated municipality and fourth densely populated city in Kerala. It was established before Indian independence under British rule and was known by the name Palghat. Palakkad is famous for the ancient Palakkad Fort, which is situated at the heart of the city and was captured and rebuilt by Hyder Ali in 1766. The city is situated about 347 kilometres (216 mi) northeast of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram.

                                        The 18th-century Palakkad Fort has sturdy battlements, a moat, and a Hanuman temple on its grounds. North on the Kalpathy River, the 15th-century Viswanatha Swamy Temple is the main venue of the Ratholsavam chariot festival. The river Bharathappuzha flows through Palakkad.[3] Palakkad is located on the northern bank of Bharathappuzha River.[3]

                            <p> The Palakkad Fort is said to have existed from very ancient times but believed to be constructed in the present form in 1766 A.D, but little is known of its early history. The local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was originally a tributary of the Zamorin but had become independent before the beginning of the eighteenth century.[1] In 1757 he sent a deputation to Hyder Ali seeking help against an invasion threatened by the Zamorin. Hyder Ali seized upon the opportunity to gain possession of a strategically important location such as Palghat and from that time until 1790 the fort was continually in the hands of the Mysore Sultans or the British. It was first taken by the latter in 1768 when Colonel Wood captured it during his raid on Hyder Ali's fortresses, but it was retaken by Hyder a few months later. It was recaptured by Colonel Fullarton in 1783, after a siege that lasted eleven days but was abandoned the following year. It later fell into the hands of the Zamorin's troops. In 1790 it was finally captured by the British under Colonel Stuart. It was renovated and was used as a base for operations that ended with the storming of Srirangapatnam. The fort continued to be garrisoned until the middle of the 19th century. In the early 1900s, it was converted into a taluk office.[2]</p>

                            <p> Shankumugham Beach is a beach in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, south India. The beach is on the western side of Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) and is very close to Trivandrum International Airport.

                                The vast stretch of white sand and the serene atmosphere, away from the crowd in the city, provide all the ingredients for relaxation and for spending an ideal evening. - The city of the Holy Anantha | India|url=https://trivandrum.nic.in/tourist-place/sankhumugham-beach/%7Caccess-date=2020-09-07%7Clanguage=en-US}}</ref> with eating kiosks and open-air theatre with car parking facilities. Good food can be enjoyed at the Old Coffee House, just across the beach, which is also a vantage point for enjoying the sunset. The beach is not well maintained, with garbage littering the entire area.
                                
                                Shanghumugham beach is considered as the ‘Arattukadavu’ of Sri Ananthapadmanabhan[1] - The presiding deity of the city. Thousands of Hindus perform ‘Bali Tharpanam’ during special occasions.[2] Shankhumugham is the prime location for Ganesh Nimarjan at the time of Vinayaka Chathurthi.[3]</p>
